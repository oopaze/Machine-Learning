All my progress with Machine Learning - From Perceptron to Neural Network

On this repository I'll show you how is going all my progress using Machine Learning
From the start and 'till I can. My final job is make a Neural Network based on Deep Learning,
but from now, let's start with just a Percpetron. 

Thanks and that's it!


Perceptron: A artificial intelligence with only one neuronio and layer

RedeNeural: A artificial intelligence with multiples neuronium and only one layer
